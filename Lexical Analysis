Lexical analysis is the first phase of a compiler and plays a crucial role in processing the source code. 
It involves breaking down the source code into a sequence of tokens.
Tokens are the smallest units of meaning in a programming language.
The output of the lexical analysis is a stream of tokens that the subsequent phases of the compiler use to 
build the abstract syntax tree and generate machine code or intermediate representations.
